Last-Edit-Finder:
Last-Edit-Finder is a lightweight browser extension designed for students, researchers, and fact-checkers. It instantly identifies when a website was last modified, helping you determine the "currency" and reliability of your sources at a glance.

Why Use Last-Edit-Finder?: In academic research, the CRAAP Test (Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, and Purpose) is vital. Many websites hide their publication dates or make them hard to find. This extension automates that search by:

- Scanning Meta Tags for hidden timestamps.

- Providing a quick way to verify if information is outdated.

Features:

- One-Click Check: View the last modified date directly from your browser toolbar.
- Smart Detection: Looks for Last-Modified headers and article:modified_time tags.
- Minimalist Design: No heavy UI—just the information you need, when you need it.
- Student-Focused: Built specifically to assist with citations and source evaluation.
